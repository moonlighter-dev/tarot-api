## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB

I'm building an API about Tarot cards and used it to deliver readings dynamically, as well as allowing a user to save and have access to previous readings. The user can create and change a profile that includes their birthdate and corresponding tarot card information on them based on year of birth, zodiac sign, etc.

## Lessons Learned:

So far, I'm learning that getting started is the hard part. The rest is just research.
